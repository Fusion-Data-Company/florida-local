## 💡 Future Optimizations (Optional)

If you want to improve performance later:
- Convert videos to web-optimized MP4 format (smaller files)
- Add multiple resolutions for different devices
- Use a CDN for faster video delivery

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

If videos don't appear after publishing:

1. **Check Deployment Logs**
   - Look for "Found 5 video files" message
   - Verify "Videos folder copied" message

2. **Test Video URLs Directly**
   - Visit: `https://your-app.replit.app/Videos/discover-bg.mov`
   - Should download/stream the video file

3. **Clear Browser Cache**
   - Hard reload: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   - Or open in incognito/private window
