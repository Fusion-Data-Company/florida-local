Fix login redirection and authentication errors in production

7 messages & 22 actions
I understand this has been extremely frustrating. Let me verify the authentication system is actually working correctly before we deploy again.
There have been deployment issues because the files used in this process

I see the core issue now. Looking at your production logs, there are **NO authentication initialization logs** - no strategy registration, no OIDC setup, nothing. This means the production deployment is not running the authentication code at all.

Fix deployment issues by automatically copying frontend build files
11 minutes of work
The deployment failed with the following error:

The deployment is failing health checks at the / endpoint. The health check is timing out or returning a non-200 status code.
The application may be listening on the wrong port or not responding quickly enough to the / endpoint.
Port 5000 is forwarded to external port 80, but the application may not be listening on port 5000 or 0.0.0.0.
Suggested fixes include:

Ensure the application listens on port 5000 (which maps to external port 80) and binds to 0.0.0.0, not localhost or 127.0.0.1. Check your start command and server configuration.
The / endpoint health check is timing out. Optimize the /health or / endpoint to respond faster by removing expensive operations like comprehensive database checks during the initial health check.
Add a simple, fast-responding / endpoint that returns 200 immediately without any async operations to pass deployment health checks.
Configure the .replit file to ensure port 5000 (internal) maps to external port 80 for Autoscale Deployments.
Ensure the server starts quickly by avoiding expensive global operations. Move database initialization and health checks to happen after the server starts listening.
Can you apply the suggested fixes?

I see the issue. The deployment health check is timing out because the server takes too long to start. All the expensive initialization (database, auth setup, file copying) happens **before** the server starts listening on port 5000. Let me fix this by: 1. Starting the server **immediately** on port 5000 2. Moving initialization to happen **after** the server is listening 3. Adding a fast `/health` endpoint for health checks
here are the logs for what you are working on. continue with this context

I see the LSP errors. The issue is that `registerRoutes` creates its own server internally, but I'm creating a server before calling it. Let me fix this properly:
