2025-10-15T19:59:21Z error: The deployment failed because the application failed to open a port in time. This can happen because the application takes to long to open a server, or doesn't open one at all on the expected port. Note that this doesn't mean that the application is crashing, only that it's not opening a port in time. The application must serve traffic on the first port specified as 'localPort' in the port configuration specified in the .replit file. Make sure that the application opens a port quickly and that there are no operations taking too long on startup. Check the logs for more information.
