📝 Prompt for Replit Agent Builder
Here's a concise prompt to give to the Replit Agent Builder:
CONTEXT: Authentication was failing with 404 errors on /api/auth/user and black screen after login.

CHANGES MADE (DO NOT REVERT):
1. Enabled auth router in server/router/index.ts (lines 27-30)
2. Removed old setupAuth() call from server/routes.ts (import and function call)
3. Fixed user upsert in server/storage.ts to use Replit ID instead of email as primary key
4. Fixed strategy naming in server/auth/index.ts to use "replitauth:domain" format
5. Fixed profileImageUrl typo in server/auth/index.ts

THESE FILES HAVE CRITICAL AUTH FIXES - DO NOT MODIFY:
- server/router/index.ts (lines 27-30)
- server/routes.ts (lines 4, 157-158)
- server/storage.ts (lines 598-628)
- server/auth/index.ts (lines 55-60, 79)

The authentication system now works with a single, consolidated auth flow using the new auth system in server/auth/.

🎯 What You Need to Do Now
Option 1: Test Immediately (Recommended)
# Kill any running processes
pkill -f node

# Start the development server
npm run dev
Then:
Open your app in the browser
Click the "Sign In" button
Complete the Replit OAuth flow
Verify you're logged in (should see your profile/user menu)
Check browser console for any errors
Verify /api/auth/user returns 200 OK (not 404)
Option 2: Deploy to Production
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
Expected Behavior:
✅ Sign In Flow:
Click "Sign In" → Redirects to Replit OAuth
Authorize app → Redirects back to your app
See user profile/menu (NOT black screen)
/api/auth/user returns your user data
✅ What Should Work Now:
Sign in button works
OAuth callback completes successfully
User is created/updated in database with Replit ID
Session persists across page reloads
Protected routes work
No more 404 on /api/auth/user
No more black screen after login
If Something Goes Wrong:
Check the server logs for:
# Look for these success messages:
✅ Authentication system initialized successfully
✅ Auth router mounted
✅ Strategy registered: replitauth:yourdomain
✅ User upserted successfully
✅ User logged in successfully
Common issues:
Still getting 404 on /api/auth/user → Server didn't restart properly
Black screen after OAuth → Check browser console and server logs
"Strategy not found" error → Check your REPLIT_DOMAINS environment variable
Quick Health Check:
# Check if auth routes are registered
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health

# Check auth status (should return 401 when not logged in)
curl http://localhost:5000/api/auth/user
That's it! The critical fixes are done. Just restart your server and test the sign-in flow. If it works, you're production-ready! 🚀
