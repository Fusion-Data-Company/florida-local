Introduction

This document summarizes the content and structure of the Home page at thefloridalocal.com as of October 1 2025.  It breaks down every major section from top to bottom, explaining the purpose, layout, text, imagery and calls‑to‑action.  Design elements such as colors, typography, spacing and effects are noted so a developer or designer can reconstruct the page faithfully.  Citations in brackets correspond to screenshots captured during analysis.

1. Site header / navigation

The logo shows a red location pin followed by the purple wordmark “THE FLORIDA LOCALS”.  On the far right, circular buttons link to Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter.  A theme‑toggle (showing “Dark” and a moon icon) lets users switch modes, and a user/profile icon links to an account page.
