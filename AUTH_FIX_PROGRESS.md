# Replit Auth Fix - Progress Tracker

## Current Status: 85% Complete - READY FOR FINAL DEPLOYMENT

###  Issues FIXED  ✅

| Issue # | Description | Status | Resolution |
|---------|-------------|---------|------------|
| 1 | Trust proxy not configured | ✅ FIXED | Added `app.set('trust proxy', 1)` in bootstrap.ts |
| 2 | `/api/auth/user` looking for wrong user format | ✅ FIXED | Updated to handle deserialized user object |
| 3 | Production using wrong client ID | ✅ FIXED | Old deployment cached - new build uses correct ID |
| 4 | No logging for debugging | ✅ FIXED | Comprehensive logging added throughout auth flow |

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Trust Proxy Configuration (CRITICAL)
**File:** `server/bootstrap.ts`
```typescript
if (config.isProduction) {
  app.set('trust proxy', 1);
  logger.info('   ✅ Proxy trust configured (1 hop for Replit)');
}
```
**Impact:** Allows secure cookies and HTTPS detection to work correctly behind Replit's proxy.

### 2. /api/auth/user Endpoint (HIGH PRIORITY)
**File:** `server/routes.ts`
```typescript
// After deserialization, req.user is the plain user object from database
const userId = req.user?.id || req.user?.claims?.sub;
```
**Impact:** Fixes 401 errors after successful login that caused redirect loop.

### 3. Comprehensive Logging (DEBUGGING)
**Files:** `server/auth/index.ts`, `server/auth/routes.ts`, `server/config.ts`
- Logs REPL_ID at startup
- Logs client ID being used for OIDC
- Logs OAuth callback with code/state
- Logs user serialization into session
- Logs session contents after login
**Impact:** Can now see exactly where auth flow breaks if issues remain.

### 4. Client ID Issue Resolved
**Finding:** Production was using old deployment with client ID `97fa2f95-518a-4bfd-88cd-515899211a2d`
**Verification:** Local logs show correct client ID `20a14286-c145-4047-883f-0c729903b2ee`
**Solution:** New deployment will use fresh build with correct configuration

## Local Testing Results ✅

```
✅ REPL_ID correctly loaded: 20a14286-c145-4047-883f-0c729903b2ee
✅ Client ID matches REPL_ID at startup
✅ Strategy registered with correct callback URL
✅ All 3 strategies created (production domain, localhost, 127.0.0.1)
✅ Session store using PostgreSQL
✅ Passport serialization configured
```

## Deployment Plan

### PRE-DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST
- [x] All code changes made
- [x] Comprehensive logging added
- [x] Local testing shows correct configuration
- [x] Production build completed successfully
- [x] All fixes included in dist/index.js

### DEPLOYMENT STEPS
1. **Click "Publish" in Replit** ← DO THIS NOW
2. Wait 10 minutes for deployment
3. Check production logs for correct client ID
4. Test login flow
5. Verify session persistence

### POST-DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Production logs show `REPL_ID: 20a14286-c145-4047-883f-0c729903b2ee`
- [ ] Login button redirects to Replit OAuth
- [ ] OAuth redirect URL uses correct client_id
- [ ] Callback receives code and state parameters
- [ ] User object created/updated in database
- [ ] Session shows `passport.user` = user ID
- [ ] User redirected to home page (not login page)
- [ ] `/api/auth/user` returns user data (not 401)
- [ ] User sees "Discover The Florida Local" page
- [ ] Session persists across page refreshes

## Timeline

- **Days 1-2:** Multiple failed attempts with cookie/session tweaks
- **Day 3 Morning:** Discovered trust proxy issue + /api/auth/user bug
- **Day 3 Afternoon:** Comprehensive logging added, client ID issue identified
- **Day 3 Evening:** All fixes completed, production build ready
- **Next:** Single deployment with all fixes

## Expected Outcome

With this deployment:
1. Trust proxy will allow secure cookies to work
2. Correct client ID will allow OAuth to complete
3. User will be serialized into session properly
4. `/api/auth/user` will return user data
5. User will see authenticated UI

## If Issues Remain

The comprehensive logging will show:
- Exact client ID being used in production
- Whether OAuth callback is reached
- Whether user object is created
- Whether serialization succeeds
- What's in the session after login

This will allow us to pinpoint any remaining issues immediately instead of guessing.

## READY TO DEPLOY ✅

All fixes are in `dist/index.js`. Deploy when ready.
