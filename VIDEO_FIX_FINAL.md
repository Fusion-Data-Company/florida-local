# üé¨ VIDEO BACKGROUNDS - FINAL FIX COMPLETE

## ‚úÖ ALL 4 VIDEOS NOW WORKING

### **The 3 Critical Bugs That Were Blocking Videos:**

1. **‚ùå .gitignore was blocking deployment**
   - `dist/public/` was in .gitignore
   - Videos were built to `dist/public/Videos/` but NOT committed to git
   - Replit deployment only includes files in git
   - **FIX:** Removed `dist/public/` from .gitignore, force-added Videos folder

2. **‚ùå Z-index stacking was hiding videos**
   - Video container had `z-index: 1`
   - Content layers had `z-index: 10, 20, 30, etc.`
   - Content was rendering ON TOP of videos, completely covering them
   - **FIX:** Changed video z-index from 1 to 0 (behind all content)

3. **‚ùå Conditional opacity made videos invisible**
   - Video had `opacity: isLoaded ? 1 : 0`
   - If video didn't load instantly, opacity was 0 (invisible)
   - **FIX:** Changed to always `opacity: 1`
